                <summary>How does choosing a contractor make a difference in my custom home?
                </summary>
                <p>
                    Your new construction or remodeling results depend entirely on what contractor to work with.
                    Irresponsible or inexperienced contractors can surpass your budget and leave you with a half
                    finished mess. Or they can delay the project so long, your hair turns white before you can enjoy it.
                    <br>
                    Choosing a respected general contractor company with a solid reputation by and large guarantees a
                    good experience for your home remodel. And Hartel Homes has trained under experts, won crucial
                    projects to gain the right experience and come out on top as NARI General Contractor of the Year
                    Award for Best Home Addition Under $250k.
                    <br> <br>
                    Have you ever paid for a cheap product and then have it fall apart after just a few uses? It’s like
                    a dollar store item parading as heavy-duty – it’s just not going to last.
                    <br> <br>
                    Unfortunately, all too many contractors can give you the same kind of experience. Too often,
                    builders take advantage of inexperienced homeowners and underbid, cut corners, or straight up
                    disappear with their money.
                    <br>
                    Whether you’re looking to add a bonus room to your house or start a full renovation, we’ve got you
